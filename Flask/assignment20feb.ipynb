    "\n",
    "        In Python, the HTTP protocol can be used to communicate between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server. Two common HTTP methods are GET and POST.\n",
    "        The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. It sends a request to the server asking for some data, which is typically encoded in the URL. For example, if you visit a website like http://example.com/search?q=python, you're making a GET request with a parameter q=python to search for results containing the word \"python\".\n",
    "\n",
    "        The POST method, on the other hand, is used to submit data to a server. It sends data as part of the request body, rather than in the URL. This is useful when you need to send large amounts of data, or when the data needs to be kept private.\n",

    "\n",
    "        requests is not typically used directly in Flask applications, but it is a useful Python library for sending HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Flask is a web framework for building web applications in Python. One common use case for Flask is to build web applications that serve HTTP requests and responses. When a Flask application receives a request, it processes the request and generates a response to send back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The requests library can be used in a Flask application to make HTTP requests to other servers or APIs. For example, if you're building a Flask application that needs to communicate with a third-party API, you can use requests to send HTTP requests to that API and receive responses."
