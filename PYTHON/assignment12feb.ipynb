    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "        An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are runtime errors that can be raised when the program encounters unexpected situations, such as division by zero, trying to access an undefined variable, or attempting to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the code does not follow the correct syntax for the programming language. Syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before the program is executed, and they prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is when they occur. Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Exceptions can be handled using exception handling constructs such as try and except, while syntax errors cannot be handled in the same way.\n",

Additionally, a message is also printed to the console indicating that division by zero is not allowed.\n",
