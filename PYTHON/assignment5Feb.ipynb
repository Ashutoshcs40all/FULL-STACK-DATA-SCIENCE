The data and methods of a class are defined inside the the class body, ehich is indented. For example:"

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language. Everything in Python is an object. Like other Object-Oriented languages, when creating objects using classes, there are  four(4) basic principles for writing clean and concise code. These principles are called the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). These four pillars are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.these four pillars are called object-oriented programming.\n",
    "        Inheritence:::: In Python it is possible to create an object that inherits the methods and properties of another object. This is called inheritance. In inheritance, there is a parent class and a child class. A child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class. \n",
    "        Polymorphism::: Polymorphism simply means 'many forms'. In Python this means that you can have one function or object that can be used in different ways. Let's take an example of the addition operator (+); we can use it to add numbers.\n",
    "        In OOP, polymorphism can be implemented with inheritance. The methods of the child class will have the same name as those of the parent class. The child class method overrides the method inherited from the parent class, when called with the child class object. This kind of implementation is called method overriding. \n",
    "        Encapsulation:::Encapsulation is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a 'capsule' or unit, so that it can not be accessed or modified outside of that unit. This is achieved by making variables inside a class private. In Python we can make variables private by prefixing the variable name with a double underscore '__'. \n",
    "        If you do not want to make the data private, you can make it protected. To make the variable protected, you only need to prefix the variable with a single underscore '_'. However, protected data can be accessed and modified outside the class. Adding a single underscore is simply a conventional way of informing other programmers that may use your code that the variable with an underscore prefix is protected and should not be modified.\n",
    "        Abstraction::: The fourth piller of oops is abstraction. Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user. In OOP abstraction is achieved by creating an interface class (base class) and implementation classes(subclasses.)"
