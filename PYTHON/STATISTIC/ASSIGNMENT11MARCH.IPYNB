    "    A z-test is more appropriate when the sample size is large (typically above 30), while a t-test is more appropriate when the sample size is small (typically below 30).\n",

    "\n",
    "    1.) Z-Test: Suppose we want to test whether the mean height of all 18-year-old males in the United States is equal to 70 inches. We have access to a large sample of heights and know the population standard deviation is 3 inches. In this case, we can use a z-test to test the null hypothesis that the mean height is equal to 70 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.) T-Test: Suppose we want to test whether there is a significant difference in the mean time it takes two groups of workers to complete a task. We have two independent samples of sizes 10 and 12, respectively. We do not know the population standard deviation, but we can estimate it from the sample. In this case, we can use a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that the population means of the two groups are equal.\n",

    "    One-tailed and two-tailed tests are types of hypothesis tests used in statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A one-tailed test, also known as a directional test, is a statistical test where the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis in only one direction. This means that the test is designed to detect an effect in a specific direction. For example, if we want to test whether a new drug is better than an existing drug, we might use a one-tailed test to determine if the new drug is statistically better than the existing drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A two-tailed test, also known as a non-directional test, is a statistical test where the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis in both directions. This means that the test is designed to detect a difference, whether it is positive or negative. For example, if we want to test whether a new teaching method improves test scores, we might use a two-tailed test to determine if the new teaching method is statistically different from the old method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The choice between a one-tailed and two-tailed test depends on the research question being asked and the directionality of the effect being tested. In general, a one-tailed test is more powerful and requires a smaller sample size to detect an effect, but it is only appropriate when there is a strong theoretical or empirical basis for predicting the direction of the effect. A two-tailed test, on the other hand, is more conservative and is appropriate when there is no strong prior expectation about the direction of the effect."

    "    Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It is named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century British statistician and philosopher.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bayes's theorem can be stated mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(H|E) = P(E|H) x P(H) / P(E)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    In other words, Bayes's theorem tells us how to revise our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is an example scenario to illustrate Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose there is a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. A diagnostic test has been developed that is 95% accurate, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of people with the disease and 95% of people without the disease.\n",

    "    If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",

    "\n",
    "-- H: the hypothesis that the person has the disease\n",
    "\n",
    "-- E: the evidence that the person tests positive for the disease\n",
    "\n",
    "        We want to calculate P(H|E), the probability of the person having the disease given that they test positive.\n",

    "    We know that the prior probability of the person having the disease is P(H) = 0.01 (1% of the population has the disease). We also know that the accuracy of the test is P(E|H) = 0.95 (if the person has the disease, the test correctly identifies it 95% of the time) and P(E|~H) = 0.05 (if the person does not have the disease, the test incorrectly identifies them as having the disease 5% of the time).\n",
