The sets are often labeled with a descriptive name, such as \"animals,\" \"plants,\" or \"mathematicians.\" The overlapping areas of the sets show the relationships between the groups of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "        Skewness in data is a measure of the degree of asymmetry in a distribution. In a symmetrical distribution, the data are evenly distributed around the mean, and the distribution has zero skewness. However, in an asymmetric distribution, the data are not evenly distributed around the mean, and the distribution has a nonzero skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A positively skewed distribution has a long tail on the right-hand side, and the mean is greater than the median. This is because there are a few large values that pull the mean to the right. Examples of data that may exhibit positive skewness include income, sales figures, and stock prices.\n",

    "    A negatively skewed distribution has a long tail on the left-hand side, and the mean is less than the median. This is because there are a few small values that pull the mean to the left. Examples of data that may exhibit negative skewness include test scores, reaction times, and waiting times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Skewness can have important implications for data analysis and modeling. For example, in regression analysis, the presence of skewness can violate assumptions of normality and lead to biased estimates. Therefore, it is important to be aware of skewness in the data and take appropriate steps to account for it in analysis and modeling."
