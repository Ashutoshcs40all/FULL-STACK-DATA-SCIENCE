    "        An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.\n",

    "        The definitions and protocols within an API help businesses connect the many different applications they use in day-to-day operations, which saves employees time and breaks down silos that hinder collaboration and innovation. For developers, API documentation provides the interface for communication between applications, simplifying application integration.\n",

    "    Flexible delivery of services: API provides fast and flexible delivery of services according to developers’ requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Integration: The best feature of API is that it allows the movement of data between various sites and thus enhances the integrated user experience.\n",

    "    Disadvantages of APIs \n",
    "    Cost: Developing and implementing API is costly at times and requires high maintenance and support from developers.\n",
    "    Security issues: Using API adds another layer of surface which is then prone to attacks, and hence the security risk problem is common in APIs."

    "        REST: Representational State Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "    REST is a set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications. Because it's a set of guidelines, it leaves the implementation of these recommendations to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a request for data is sent to a REST API, it’s usually done through hypertext transfer protocol (commonly referred to as HTTP). Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST (called RESTful APIs or RESTful web services) can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON. JSON (JavaScript object notation) is favored as a message format because it can be read by any programming language (despite the name), is human- and machine-readable, and is lightweight. In this way, RESTful APIs are more flexible and can be easier to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An application is said to be RESTful if it follows 6 architectural guidelines. A RESTful application must have:\n",
    "        A client-server architecture composed of clients, servers, and resources.\n",
    "    Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client content is stored on the server between requests. Information about the session’s state is instead held with the client.\n",
    "    Cacheable data to eliminate the need for some client-server interactions.\n",
    "    A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standardized form instead of specific to an application’s needs. This is described by Roy Fielding, the originator of REST, as “the central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles.”\n",
    "    A layered system constraint, where client-server interactions can be mediated by hierarchical layers.\n",
    "    Code on demand, allowing servers to extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (though also reducing visibility, making this an optional guideline).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "    SOAP is a standard protocol that was first designed so that applications built with different languages and on different platforms could communicate. Because it is a protocol, it imposes built-in rules that increase its complexity and overhead, which can lead to longer page load times. However, these standards also offer built-in compliances that can make it preferable for enterprise scenarios. The built-in compliance standards include security, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), which is a set of properties for ensuring reliable database transactions.\n",
    "Common web service specifications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Web services security (WS-security): Standardizes how messages are secured and transferred through unique identifiers called tokens.\n",
    "        WS-ReliableMessaging: Standardizes error handling between messages transferred across unreliable IT infrastructure.\n",
    "    Web services addressing (WS-addressing): Packages routing information as metadata within SOAP headers, instead of maintaining such information deeper within the network.\n",
    "    Web services description language (WSDL): Describes what a web service does, and where that service begins and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "        When a request for data is sent to a SOAP API, it can be handled through any of the application layer protocols: HTTP (for web browsers), SMTP (for email), TCP, and others. However, once a request is received, return SOAP messages must be returned as XML documents—a markup language that is both human- and machine-readable. A completed request to a SOAP API is not cacheable by a browser, so it cannot be accessed later without resending to the API."
